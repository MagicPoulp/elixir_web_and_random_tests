cat /home/test/.config/systemd/user/try13.service

systemd/user is a global for all users but not as root
but then the standard output/error redirect does not work
Hence we use the one in the home directory
And there must be a proper login of the user

systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user start try13
systemctl --user status try13
systemctl --user stop try13
journalctl | less
tail /var/log/test/thierry-script-stderr.log

-----

to run stuff, we need a test and a developer user both in the host and in the chroot
install all programs logged in a separate file of the repository
change the shell to bash in the passwd
add the configuration debian chroot to avoid chroot to spawn daemons
all config files are in teh repo, for systemd and the schroot
the home folder for developer is copies inside the home folder of test for the environment, then all must be compiled inside the chroot in the test folder.
we need gcc-multilib
and several libraries of libstdc++ of different versions are needed, libcat, etc
